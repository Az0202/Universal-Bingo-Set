# Universal Bingo Set

## Description:
The Universal Bingo/Universal Set project, developed during my studies at Piedmont Virginia Community College under the guidance of Professor David Duvall-Early, provides a generic Set data structure implementation that supports various data types, with a specific example utilizing Bingo Balls. This data structure adheres to the Set properties of uniqueness and unordered storage, and does not allow modification of elements once inserted. The project is developed in C++ and showcases static polymorphism through templated classes.


## Features:
* Generic Implementation: Supports any data type, allowing flexible usage across different scenarios.
* Bingo Ball Example: Includes a specialized implementation for handling Bingo Balls, demonstrating the set with a real-world use case.
* Efficiency Analysis: Each function within the Set class has been analyzed for efficiency, providing insights into the computational complexity.
* Standard Compliance: Conforms to predefined header files and coding standards, ensuring compatibility and reliability.

## Technologies Used:
* C++
* Standard Template Library (STL) components (e.g., vectors)

## Compile the project (ensure you have a C++ compiler installed):
* g++ -std=c++11 Set.cpp SetExpand.cpp main.cpp -o setApp
